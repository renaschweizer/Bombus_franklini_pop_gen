#### Raw sequence data are available on the NCBI SRA under BioProject PRJNA1201183. 

#### Scripts are organized as follows:

+ *genotyping_processing* scripts used to go from raw reads to filtered genotypes.

+ *pop_structure* for calculating pop statistics, PCA, admixture.

+ *de_novo_assembly* for generating *de novo* genome assemblies and extracting COI sequence.

+ *demography* for running PSMC and GONE analyses. 

+ *simulation_pipeline* includes scripts and files used for the msprime simulations.

+ *R_analyses* contains all of the R code for running analyses and generating plots.
