Raw sequence data are available on the NCBI SRA under BioProject PRJNA1201183. 

Scripts are organized as follows:

*genotyping_processing* scripts used to go from raw reads to filtered genotypes.

*simulation_pipeline* includes scripts and files used for the msprime simulations.

*bfrank.Md* contains all of the R code for running analyses and generating plots. bfrank_02June2025.html is the output.
